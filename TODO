API's to be added:

	Accounting API
	Checkpointing API
	Parallel Job API

Testing:
	Only minimal testing so far under one version

ll_get_data is a monstorous hack

llquery & llsubmit make ll_get_data look like a nice tidy call

llsubmit & ll_get_jobs return a horrific representation of the LL_Job structure

LL_Job structure is not complete

llapi.h needs to be converted using h2ph

more tests and examples need to be added.

ll_set_request ObjectFilter unpacking needs improving

Improve handling of 64 bit return types.
